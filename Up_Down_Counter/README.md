# 🔁 Up-Down Counter (3-bit)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation and simulation of a 3-bit Up-Down Counter, a fundamental sequential digital circuit widely used in digital systems for bidirectional counting operations.

## 📘 Description

An Up-Down Counter is a synchronous counter that can count incrementally (up) or decrementally (down) based on a control signal. It changes its count state on the rising (or falling) edge of a clock signal and is often used in applications where both forward and backward counting is needed.
