# 🔁 Up-Down Counter (3-bit)

This repository contains the Verilog implementation and simulation of a 3-bit Up-Down Counter, a fundamental sequential digital circuit widely used in digital systems for bidirectional counting operations.

## 📘 Description

An Up-Down Counter is a synchronous counter that can count incrementally (up) or decrementally (down) based on a control signal. It changes its count state on the rising (or falling) edge of a clock signal and is often used in applications where both forward and backward counting is needed.

## 📌 Applications

The Up-Down Counter is a versatile digital circuit and is widely used in the following areas:

⏰ Digital Clocks – for counting seconds, minutes, and hours.

🛗 Elevator Controllers – to track floor positions in both upward and downward directions.

⚙️ Stepper Motor Controllers – for precise bidirectional movement control.

🔄 Frequency Dividers – where the counter helps divide the input clock frequency.

🧠 Finite State Machines (FSMs) – as state transition counters in control units.

🎮 Game Score Counters – to count player scores or levels with increment/decrement actions.

🧪 Digital Instruments – such as event counters or frequency meters.

## ✅ Conclusion

The 3-bit Up-Down Counter demonstrates a fundamental concept in sequential digital design, highlighting how counting operations can be managed bidirectionally using control logic and flip-flops. Understanding and implementing such counters strengthens core skills in Verilog HDL, synchronous design principles, and state-based circuit behavior—an essential step toward building more complex systems like ALUs, timers, and FSMs.

This project reinforces key concepts of digital electronics while providing practical HDL coding experience using tools like Vivado or ModelSim.
