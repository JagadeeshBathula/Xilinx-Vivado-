# Simple Water Tank Control in Verilog (RTL Challenge)

A basic water tank controller designed in Verilog RTL, where the testbench acts as a sensor providing simulated water levels. The controller monitors the tank level and activates motor_on or motor_off signals when the water is below or above specified thresholds.

## Features:

Synchronous design with reset handling

Parametrized water-level thresholds

Testbench simulates sensor input

Motor control logic based on water level

## Purpose:
This project is a simple RTL challenge to practice Verilog coding, digital design, and simulation workflows, ideal for beginners and learning verification.

## Vivado Implementation
