# 📦 Parallel-In Parallel-Out (PIPO) Shift Register

## 📝 Description

A PIPO (Parallel-In Parallel-Out) shift register is a fundamental digital circuit that allows data to be loaded and retrieved simultaneously across multiple lines. It doesn't perform any serial shifting — instead, it functions as a group of flip-flops used for storing parallel data.

This type of register is often used in systems where quick data access is needed without the overhead of bit-by-bit shifting.

## ⚙️ Working Principle

The register consists of n D-type flip-flops, each responsible for one bit.

On the rising edge of the clock, the data present on the parallel input lines is captured and stored.

The stored values are then immediately available on the parallel output lines.

There is no shift operation involved between the flip-flops.
