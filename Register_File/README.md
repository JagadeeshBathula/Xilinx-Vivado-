# Register File 


## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Register File in Verilog, a fundamental building block used in processors for temporary data storage during instruction execution.

The design supports:

1 Write Port (synchronous write on clock edge)

2 Read Ports (parallel read access)

8 registers, each 16 bits wide

## ⚙️ Features

Synchronous write operation (write_en, write_addr, write_in)

Parallel read support (read_addr_1, read_addr_2)

Clean RTL architecture with testbench verification

Easily scalable for different register sizes
