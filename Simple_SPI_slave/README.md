#  SIMPLE SPI SLAVE

A SPI slave is a digital device that communicates with a SPI master. It receives data from the master via MOSI, sends data back via MISO, and is activated only when the Slave Select (SS) signal is low. It shifts data bit by bit on each clock cycle of sclk and signals when a full byte has been received using a done flag.
