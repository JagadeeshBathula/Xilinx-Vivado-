# ✨ Design Project: Sequence Detector (FSM-based)

## 🔍 What is a Sequence Detector?

 A sequence detector is a Finite State Machine (FSM) that continuously monitors a serial input stream and checks for the occurrence of a predefined bit pattern. Once the sequence is detected, the output flag is asserted.

In this project, I designed a Moore FSM to detect the pattern 1011.

✅ States represent partial progress in matching the sequence

✅ Output depends only on the current state

✅ Supports overlapping sequence detection (e.g., 10111 → detects twice)

✅ Verified through simulation with a testbench
