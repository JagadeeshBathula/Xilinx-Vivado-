# SPI Master Slave 

SPI (Serial Peripheral Interface) is a synchronous communication protocol used to transfer data between a master device and one or more slave devices.

Synchronous → uses a shared clock (SCLK) from the master.

Full-duplex → data can be sent and received at the same time.

Single master, multiple slaves → the master selects which slave to communicate with using SS/CS (Slave Select / Chip Select).

## 2. Key Signals

SCLK (Serial Clock) – Generated by the master; all data transfers are synchronized with this clock.

MOSI (Master Out, Slave In) – Data line for sending information from the master to the slave.

MISO (Master In, Slave Out) – Data line for sending information from the slave back to the master.

SS/CS (Slave Select / Chip Select) – Active-low signal used by the master to enable a particular slave.

## 3. How It Works

Master starts communication :

Pulls the SS line of the desired slave low.

Generates clock pulses on SCLK.

Data transfer :

Master sends data bit-by-bit on MOSI.

Slave samples the data on each clock edge (rising or falling depending on SPI mode).

Slave can send data back simultaneously on MISO.

End of communication :

Master pulls SS high, signaling the end of the transaction.

Both master and slave reset internal counters and buffers for the next transfer.

## 4. SPI Modes

SPI has 4 modes determined by clock polarity (CPOL) and clock phase (CPHA).

These modes define when the data is sampled relative to the clock signal.

## 5. Master vs Slave Roles

Role	Responsibility

Master	Generates clock, controls SS, sends/receives data

Slave	Listens to SCLK & SS, receives data on MOSI, sends data on MISO

## 6. Advantages

High-speed communication.

Simple hardware.

Full-duplex operation.

Limitation:

Requires separate SS lines for multiple slaves.

No standard error checking (like I²C’s ACK).
