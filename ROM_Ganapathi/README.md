# 🌺 RTL Project | Ganapathi Image Display Using ROM 🌺

This project is very close to my heart as it combines technology and devotion. Using Verilog RTL, I designed a ROM-based system that stores pixel data to display a beautiful image of Lord Ganapathi. Every bit of data was carefully fed to bring the image to life on the output.

Working on this project made me realize how engineering precision and devotion can beautifully coexist. Through this small effort, I offer my digital creation as a tribute to Ganapathi, seeking wisdom and guidance in all endeavors. 🙏

## ✨ Highlights:

ROM-based pixel data storage & retrieval

Accurate RTL design with Verilog

A creative blend of digital design and devotion

May Lord Ganapathi bless us with knowledge, creativity, and perseverance in every project we undertake! 🛠️🙏
