# 1-Bit SRAM (Static Random Access Memory)

##üìå Overview

This project implements a 1-bit SRAM cell in Verilog.
SRAM (Static RAM) is a type of volatile memory that stores data as long as power is supplied. Unlike DRAM, it doesn‚Äôt require periodic refreshing, making it faster and simpler for small-scale designs.

## ‚ö° Features

Read/Write operations controlled by a signal

Single-bit storage capability

Address-controlled access

Clocked write operation and combinational read logic

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è Working Principle

Write Operation

When read_write = 1 and address = 1, the input data (data_in) is stored into the SRAM cell on the rising edge of the clock.

Read Operation

When read_write = 0 and address = 1, the stored data is sent to the output (data_out).

Idle/Unselected


If address = 0, the cell is not selected, and the output remains in high-impedance (Z).
