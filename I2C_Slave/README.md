# Simple I2C Slave 

An I²C slave is a device connected to the I²C bus that responds to commands sent by an I²C master.
It does not control the clock; it only listens and reacts. The master initiates communication, and the slave either:

Receives data from the master (Write mode), or

Sends data to the master (Read mode)

Key roles of an I²C slave:

Listens on the SDA and SCL lines

Recognizes its assigned address

Responds when addressed

Sends or receives bytes as instructed

Generates or accepts ACK/NACK bits
