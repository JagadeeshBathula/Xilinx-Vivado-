# Radix-4 Booth Multiplier 🚀

## 📌 Project Overview

This project implements a Radix-4 Booth Multiplier using Verilog RTL. The Booth algorithm improves multiplication efficiency by reducing the number of partial products, making it highly suitable for high-speed digital systems and VLSI applications.

## 🔑 Key Features

✔️ Radix-4 Booth encoding for efficient multiplication

✔️ RTL-level implementation in Verilog

✔️ Testbench for functional verification

✔️ Optimized for reduced computation cycles compared to traditional methods

## 🎯 Learning Outcomes

Stronger understanding of Booth’s algorithm

Practical exposure to digital arithmetic design

RTL design, simulation, and verification skills

## 🙏 Acknowledgment
